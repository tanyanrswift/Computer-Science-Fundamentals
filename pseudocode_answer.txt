1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
  Programmers use pseudocode because it allows them to communicate to other programmers what they would like to do in a program without using the syntax of a
   particular coding language. It gives other programmers a way to understand what we want our program and our code to do. It is also a way to brainstorm what
    you would like your code to do.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
  If you ran pseudocode on your computer, it wouldn't do anything because it isn't written in a language that a computer can interpret.

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

  1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
      INPUT two numbers, number 1 and number 2
      IF number 1 is greater than number 2 THEN
        PRINT number 1
      ELSE
        PRINT number2
      END IF
  2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
      SET number to 1
      FOR each number from 1 to 100
        INCREMENT number by 1
        PRINT the number
      END FOR
  3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
      INPUT an entry and a phonebook
      SET phonebook to first phonebook entry
      FOR each phonebook entry
        RETURN the name of the entry
      IF the entry is the same as the name in the phonebook THEN
        PRINT 'Entry is available'
      ELSE
        PRINT 'Entry is not found'
      END IF
  4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.
      var phonebook = [];
      function findEntry(entry, phonebook) {
        var phonebookEntries = for(var i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++) {
          return phonebook[i];
        }
        if(entry === phonebookEntries) {
          return 'Entry is available';
        } else {
          return 'Entry is not found';
        }
      }
