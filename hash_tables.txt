1. What is a hash table?
  A hash table is a collection of values much like an array that has key and value pairs.

2. What is hashing?
  Hashing is the method of converting strings to numerical indexes to be used in a hash table.

3. How does a hash table store data?
  A hash table stores data in key and value pairs, with the value holding the data and the key linking to the index of the value.

4. How are hash tables and objects different?
  Objects bundle different types of data together, whereas hash tables store collections of similar data together. In other words, each object stores data
  that is similar but each object is different, and a hash table would store data that has some sort of identifier.

5. Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:
    -A list of pets and their unique names.
      hash table
    -The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend.
      object
    -The name and location of every company in a given city.
      hash table
    -All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual.
      object
    -The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact.
      object

6. Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone
    numbers. Store this information in a hash table.

    var HashTable = function() {
      var array = [];
      var size = 13;
    }

    this.add = function(key, value) {
      var index = hash(key, size);
      if (array[index] === undefined) {
        array[index] = [
          [key, value]
        ];
      } else {
        var inserted = false;
        for (var i = 0; i < array[index].length; i++) {
          if (array[index][i][0] === key) {
            array[index][i][i] = value;
            inserted = true;
          }
        }
        if (inserted === false){
          array[index].push([key, value]);
        }
      }
    };

    this.lookup = function(key) {
      var index = hash(key, size);
      if (array[index] === undefined) {
        return undefined;
      } else {
        for (var i = 0; i < array[index].length; i++) {
          if (array[index][i][0] === key) {
            return array[index][i][i];
          }
        }
      }
    };


    class CustomerInfo {
      constructor(name, address, phoneNumber) {
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
        this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
        this.size = 13;
        this.customers = new Array(this.size);
      }

      hash(text, max){
        var total = 0;
        for(var i = 0; i < text.length; i++){
          total += text.charCodeAt(i);
        }
        return total % max;
      }

      add(name, address, phoneNumber){
        var customer = new CustomerInfo(name, address, phoneNumber);
        var hashedString = hash(phoneNumber);
        Array.slice(1, 0, hashedString);
      }

      lookUpCustomer(phoneNumber){
        var hashedString = hash(phoneNumber);
        for(var i = 0; i < this.customerInfo.length; i++) {
          if(hashedString === this.customerInfo.phoneNumber) {
            return this.customerInfo.name;
          } else {
            return 'Customer cannot be found';
          }
        }
      }
    }


7. Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.


8. Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary
    data.
