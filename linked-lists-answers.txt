Memory Questions
1. Where, and in what order, does the processor look for a piece of data?
  The processor will look for a piece of data in four different locations. It starts with the registers, then the cache, then the memory, and finally the
  persistent storage.

2. Assuming a total size of 4 Gigabytes and 16-bit memory locations, what number of locations does the RAM provide?
  This will provide about 4 trillion locations for the RAM (about 4 trillion for the 4 Gigabytes, and 16 for the 16-bit memory locations).

3. Whatâ€™s the difference between volatile and persistent memory and which types exist in our memory pyramid?
  With volatile memory, data and stored information is lost when a power source is removed. Volatile memory exists in our memory pyramid.



1. What are some pros and cons of using linked lists instead of arrays?
  Linked lists are able to grow much larger in size than an array because they are stored in nodes which are independent, and can be stored anywhere in
  available memory. This is good because we can store more data and take up less space. However, a downside to using linked lists is that they are slower
  to find data within, because you must access them in order to find the data that you are looking for. This can be a much slower process than accessing
  the index of an element of an array, which can be accessed immediately with the index.

2. Come up with a real world example of a linked list.
  A real world example of a linked list could be an elevator traveling through floors of a building. Each floor in the building is connected to the others
  like the nodes in a linked list. It is a slow process as well because you have to travel through all the intermediary floors to get to the one you want
  to get to.


1. The linked list push function should take a value, create a node, and add it to the end of a list. Below is pseudocode for a push function for a singly
linked list. However, there is something wrong with it. Submit both an explanation of the bug and a functional implementation of the method.

  FUNCTION push(element)
    CREATE node
    SET node.value TO element
    SET node.next TO null

    IF the head node does not exist
      THEN SET head to node
    ELSE
      SET current to last node
      SET current.next to node
    END IF
  END FUNCTION

We had in the else statement to set current to head, but we don't know how many nodes are in the linked list. It would make more sense to set current to
the last node that way we can place the new node we are creating after that one in the linked list.

function push(element) {
  let node = new Node(element);
  node.value = element;
  node.next = null;

  if(!head.node){
    head.node = node;
  } else {
    while(current.next){
      current = current.next;
    }
    current.next = node;
  }
  this.size++;
}


2. Given an unsorted singly linked list, remove all duplicates from the linked list.
  Example
  Input: a -> c -> d -> d -> a
  Output: a -> c -> d

  We want to compare the first element to all the other elements, then remove the duplicates, then compare the second element to all remaining elements,
  etc. Then we want to display the remaining elements.

  class Node {
    constructor(value) {
      this.value = value;
      this.next = null;
    }
  }
  class LinkedList {
    constructor(){
      this.head = null;
      this.next = null;
    }
    insert(value){
      const node = new Node(value);
      if(!this.head){
        return this.head = node;
      }
      let current = this.head;
      while(current.next){
        current = current.next;
      }
        return current.next = node;
    }
    deleteDuplicates(value) {
      var firstNumberToCompare = this.head;
      while(firstNumberToCompare && firstNumberToCompare.next) {
        var secondNumberToCompare = firstNumberToCompare.next;
        while(secondNumberToCompare && secondNumberToCompare.next){
          if(firstNumberToCompare.value === secondNumberToCompare.value){
            firstNumberToCompare.next = secondNumberToCompare.next;
            secondNumberToCompare = secondNumberToCompare.next;
          } else {
            secondNumberToCompare = secondNumberToCompare.next;
          }
        }
        firstNumberToCompare = firstNumberToCompare.next;
      }
    }
  }

  var ll = new LinkedList();
  ll.insert('a');
  ll.insert('c');
  ll.insert('d');
  ll.insert('d');
  ll.insert('a');
  console.log(ll.deleteDuplicates());

3. Given an unsorted singly linked list, reverse it.
  Example
  Input: a -> b -> c -> d
  Output: d -> c -> b -> a

  class Node {
    constructor(value) {
      this.value = value;
      this.next = null;
    }
  }
  class LinkedList {
    constructor(){
      this.head = null;
      this.next = null;
    }
    insert(value){
      const node = new Node(value);
      if(!this.head){
        return this.head = node;
      }
      let current = this.head;
      while(current.next){
        current = current.next;
      }
        return current.next = node;
    }
    reverseLinkedList(value) {
      var firstNumber = this.head;
      while(firstNumber && firstNumber.next) {
        var secondNumber = firstNumber.next
        secondNumber = firstNumber.value;
        firstNumber = secondNumber.value;
        while(firstNumber && firstNumber.next && firstNumber.next.next) {
          var secondNumber = firstNumber.value;
          firstNumber = secondNumber.value;
        }
      }
      return;
    }
  }

  var ll = new LinkedList();
  ll.insert('a');
  ll.insert('b');
  ll.insert('c');
  ll.insert('d');
  console.log(ll.reverseLinkedList());
